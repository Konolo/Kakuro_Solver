# Kakuro Solver

## What is Kakuro
Kakuro or Kakkuro (Japanese: カックロ) is a kind of logic puzzle, sometimes referred to as a mathematical transliteration of the crossword, that combines elements of Sudoku and crossword puzzles.

The objective is to fill a grid with numbers 1 to 9 such that the sum of the numbers in each horizontal and vertical block matches the given clue for that block. Each block is made up of between 2 and 9 squares that need to be filled in. Each number used in a block must be unique, meaning no repetitions.

Basic Rules:
- Sum Clues: Each block has a sum clue, indicating the total of the numbers in that block.
- Unique Numbers: Each number in a block must be different.
- Valid Digits: Only the numbers 1 through 9 are allowed.
- Grid Completion: All spaces must be filled with numbers, and the puzzle is solved when all sums are correct.
